# Cooking Recipe Blog


Welcome to the Cooking Recipe Blog, a delightful culinary journey made with the power of Mongoose, EJS, Express, Node.js, and CSS. This blog is your gateway to a world of delicious recipes from various cuisines, brought to you with love and passion.

## Project Overview

This Cooking Recipe Blog is designed and developed with a set of key features and functionalities:

- **Technology Stack**: The blog is built using Mongoose, EJS, Express, Node.js, and CSS, making it a robust and efficient platform for sharing and discovering recipes.

- **Packages Installed**: We have incorporated several essential packages to enhance the functionality of our app. These include `connect-flash`, `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`, `ejs`, `express`, `express-ejs-layouts`, `express-fileupload`, `express-session`, `mongodb`, and `mongoose`.

- **Custom Logo**: Our unique Recipe Blog logo has been custom-designed to reflect our passion for cooking and sharing recipes. It embodies the essence of our culinary adventure.

## Recipe Categories

We offer a diverse range of recipe categories to cater to different tastes and preferences. Our current categories include:

- Thai
- American
- Mexican
- Indian
- Spanish
- Chinese

Each category features a signature recipe that captures the essence of its cuisine. For example, our American category showcases the popular "Chicken Tenders" recipe.

## Search Functionality

Finding your favorite recipes has never been easier. Our blog features a user-friendly search bar that allows you to search for any recipe by its name. Just type in the dish you're looking for and hit enter, and we'll take you straight to your desired recipe.

## Submit Your Recipe

We encourage our community to get involved and share their culinary creations. You can contribute by submitting your own recipes through our "Submit Recipe" form. Once approved, your recipe will be featured on our "Home" page for others to enjoy.

## Recipe Management

For recipe authors, we provide a simple recipe management system. When viewing a recipe, you'll find a small navigation bar with options to update or delete your recipe.

- **Update Recipe**: Clicking the "Update" button opens a form where you can edit and refine your recipe. It's similar to the "Submit Recipe" form, allowing you to make changes to your dish.

- **Delete Recipe**: If you wish to remove your recipe from the blog, simply click the "Delete" button. Your recipe will be promptly removed from our collection.
